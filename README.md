# Disable Right Click Targeting

A lightweight addon that disables the default **right-click to target** behavior.
I'm used to constantly micro-adjust my camera and kept losing targets because of it. 
Other addons that did this weren’t kept up to date for newer WoW versions, so I made this one.

## Features
- Stops right-click targeting entirely.
- Works automatically with no setup or configuration.
- I'm planning to kept it up to date and tested on new versions.

## Important
- Make sure "Options -> Controls -> Interact On Left Click" is enabled.
- To re-enable right-click targeting, you must disable this addon.
